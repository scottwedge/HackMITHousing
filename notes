Inverted Index ---- tag-query matching


================================
Matching Algorithm

Each user (tenant + landlord) has a vector of numbers for each tag, compare the difference between two vectors
- preferred working hours
- distance between locations: Euclidean distance? distance between coordinates --- Google Maps API, travel distance & time
---- travel time as an indicator of how far the places are
---- scoring system: 
- other tags: True or False in the vector 
--- work type: kitchen, bathroom, furniture, entire apartment
--- (optional) area of the place in ft^2, (not as a tag, just to inform the tenants)

- priority:
1. work type - first requirement, not matching means not possible
2. working hours - smaller than expectation for tenants
3. distance, indicated by walking time

- provide top 5 candidates
