The website matches landlords with candidate cleaners for their apartments, and landlords can then choose to rent to their cleaner. Each landlord and candidate also has a record of their hiring/cleaning history that serves as a reference for the matching process. The goals of the initiative include: Provide local landlords with employees who can clean their apartments and improve hygiene of the surrounding neighborhood as a result. Provide people without permanent residence with a platform to find a job, which can potentially serve as a way to find an apartment to rent.');
